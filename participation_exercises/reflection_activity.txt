Reflection Activity

Using the javadocs for java.lang.Class to learn the reflection API and the java tutorials on reflection, write code to do the following:

1) Get an instance of a Class object using the String name for ReflectionActivity.java.
2) Print out all of the constructors available for a class, including their respective parameter types.
3) Create an instance of a ReflectionActivity from its Class object by calling the ReflectionActivity(String, double) constructor.
4) Print out all of the fields (type and name) in a class (including private fields)
5) Using reflection, call the addToNumber(double) method on your ReflectionActivity instance.

You can complete all of this code in one main method. Submit that code to the LMS.
